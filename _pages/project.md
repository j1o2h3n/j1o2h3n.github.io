## RNNs
[RNNs](https://github.com/j1o2h3n/RNNs) are a series of recurrent neural networks that I implemented based on Pytorch. I did not call the original library functions. I implemented three deep learning models of RNN, LSTM, and GRU by hand, and performed sequence task prediction experiments.

## DDGCN
DDGCN is a deep learning model for traffic prediction proposed by me in 2021. The model has achieved state-of-the-art on two real-world public traffic datasets.

## DDSTGCN
[DDSTGCN](https://github.com/j1o2h3n/DDSTGCN) is a deep learning model for traffic prediction proposed by me in 2020. The model has achieved state-of-the-art on six real-world public traffic datasets.

## MRA-BGCN
[MRA-BGCN](https://github.com/j1o2h3n/MRA-BGCN) is a traffic prediction deep learning model proposed in the AAAI-2020 paper "Multi-Range Attentive Bicomponent Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Forecasting". I use the PyTorch framework to implement the code of the model proposed in this paper.

## (2D)^2FPCA
[(2D)^2FPCA](https://github.com/j1o2h3n/2D2FPCA) is a project that I completed in 2019 about image recognition and classification tasks of machine learning dimensionality reduction, written in Matlab language.

## Finger vein
[Finger vein](https://github.com/j1o2h3n/Finger_vein) is a simple finger vein skeleton extraction project based on digital image processing method that I completed in 2018. It is written by using C++ language to call OpenCV library.
